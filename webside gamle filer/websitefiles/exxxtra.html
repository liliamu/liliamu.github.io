				The installation has a familiarity in seeing oneself at the other side of the tunnel, where the real-time effect acts as an immediate confirmation that the viewer’s movement creates changes in the visualisation. Yet there is an uncanniness in looking at oneself in a distorted machine vision “mirror”, merged in an almost-familiar texture, as nature seen via a machine. This parallel draws the viewer to interact with the installation by playing, exploring, and testing a threshold of the familiar and the uncanny.

			The creative production consisted of developing, designing, and implementing the intallation. Underlying system for visualisation is an OpenFrameworks implimtation of Logan Engstroms <a href="" target="_blank">Fast Style Transfer in TensorFlow </a>. The installation was exhibited in collaboration with <a href="" target="_blank">CATCH (Center for Art + Tech) </a>, for Click festival, and showcased from May 20th to 21st, 2017, in Kulturværftet, Helsingør (pictured).
